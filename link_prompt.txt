Match the following newspaper articles to the relevant story summaries. For each bullet point, if one of the articles clearly corresponds to the story, append a markdown link in this format:

- [(CM)](https://cyprus-mail.com/...) for Cyprus Mail
- [(IC)](https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/...) for In-Cyprus

You should add links to both sources if you find articles in both that match, seperated by a comma

Use the article's actual link. If no article fits, leave the line unchanged. Do not modify or rewrite the text otherwise.
Please be sure that an article matches; don't add a link because of a vague connection in subject.
