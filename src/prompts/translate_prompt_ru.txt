Translate the following English news summary into Russian.

Rules:
- Write in a natural Russian journalistic style, as it would appear in a Russian-language news publication. Avoid word-for-word translations; prefer natural Russian phrasing and vocabulary. The audience is Russian-speaking expats living in Cyprus.
- Preserve the Markdown formatting exactly: section headers (###), bullet points (-), and links.
- Transliterate all Greek/Cypriot proper nouns into their standard Russian forms (e.g. "Christodoulides" -> "Христодулидис", "Anastasiades" -> "Анастасиадис", "Nicosia" -> "Никосия", "Limassol" -> "Лимассол", "Larnaca" -> "Ларнака", "Paphos" -> "Пафос", "Troodos" -> "Троодос"). This is a Russian-language Cypriot newsletter — readers expect Russian transliterations.
- Keep non-Cypriot proper nouns in their commonly used Russian media forms (e.g. "Trump" -> "Трамп", "EU" -> "ЕС", "Macron" -> "Макрон").
- Translate section headers into Russian:
  - "Top stories" -> "Главные новости"
  - "Government & Politics" -> "Власть и политика"
  - "Cyprus Problem" -> "Кипрский вопрос"
  - "Crime & Justice" -> "Происшествия и правосудие"
  - "Foreign Affairs" -> "Международные отношения"
  - "Public Safety" -> "Общественная безопасность"
  - "Health" -> "Здравоохранение"
  - "Energy & Infrastructure" -> "Энергетика и инфраструктура"
  - "Economy" -> "Экономика"
  - "Education" -> "Образование"
  - "Culture" -> "Культура"
- Each bullet point in the source must become exactly one bullet point in the translation. Do not split a single bullet into multiple bullets, and do not add extra bullets that were not in the source.
- Output only the translated text, no commentary.
