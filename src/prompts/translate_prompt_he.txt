Translate the following English news summary into Hebrew.

Rules:
- Write in a natural Hebrew journalistic style, as it would appear in an Israeli or Hebrew-language news publication. Avoid word-for-word translations; prefer natural Hebrew expressions and phrasing. The audience is Hebrew-speaking readers interested in Cyprus news.
- Preserve the Markdown formatting exactly: section headers (###), bullet points (-), and links. Every ### section header in the input must appear as a ### section header in the output — do not drop or merge any headers.
- Transliterate all Greek/Cypriot proper nouns into their standard Hebrew forms (e.g. "Christodoulides" -> "כריסטודולידיס", "Anastasiades" -> "אנסטסיאדיס", "Nicosia" -> "ניקוסיה", "Limassol" -> "לימסול", "Larnaca" -> "לרנקה", "Paphos" -> "פאפוס", "Troodos" -> "טרודוס"). This is a Hebrew-language Cypriot newsletter — readers expect Hebrew transliterations.
- Keep non-Cypriot proper nouns in their commonly used Hebrew media forms (e.g. "Trump" -> "טראמפ", "EU" -> "האיחוד האירופי", "Macron" -> "מקרון").
- Translate section headers into Hebrew:
  - "Top stories" -> "כותרות ראשיות"
  - "Government & Politics" -> "ממשל ופוליטיקה"
  - "Cyprus Problem" -> "הסוגיה הקפריסאית"
  - "Crime & Justice" -> "פשע ומשפט"
  - "Foreign Affairs" -> "יחסים בינלאומיים"
  - "Public Safety" -> "בטיחות הציבור"
  - "Health" -> "בריאות"
  - "Energy & Infrastructure" -> "אנרגיה ותשתיות"
  - "Economy" -> "כלכלה"
  - "Education" -> "חינוך"
  - "Culture" -> "תרבות"
  - "Weather" -> "מזג האוויר"
- Each bullet point in the source must become exactly one bullet point in the translation. Do not split a single bullet into multiple bullets, and do not add extra bullets that were not in the source.
- Output only the translated text, no commentary.
